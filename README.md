# Home Lab Setup

## Objective

Configure a simple home lab setup comprising of Kali Linux OS installed on a virtual machine within VirtualBox to conduct pentesting simulations using tools like Metasploit , Burp Suite etc.

### Skills Learned

- Explored and enhanced  skills in various tools like Nmap , Wireshark , Burpsuite , HashCat , Sqlmap , 
Metasploit , Nikto etc. 
- Gained valuable insights regarding knowledge of the linux environment and command line interface . 
- Practiced in a controlled environment inorder master penetration testing techniques, from 
reconnaissance to post-exploitation using several VMs available from TryHackMe , VulnHub etc. 
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Burp Suite Community Edition (Intercept, modify, and test web requests)
- Metasploit (Modular framework used to identify, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems and networks)
- Nmap (Network discovery and port scanning)
- Wireshark (network protocol analyzer for capturing and examining network traffic in real time)
- Netcat (Reverse shell, pivoting)
- Nikto (Web server scanner and reconnaisance)
- Hashcat (GPU-accelerated password cracker)
- Hydra (Brute-force remote login services (SSH, FTP, etc.))
- John the ripper  (Local password cracker)
- Sqlmap (Automated SQL injection tool)
